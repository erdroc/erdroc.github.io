			Hi, I'm Eric!
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm currently a PhD student in the Mechanical Engineering department working in the Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (RAIL) led by Dr. Thomas Howard at The University of Rochester (UR).
			My research focus is on robot path planning and navigation over non-flat terrain.
			This involves extensive field testing and familiarity with hardware and mathematical modelling of the physical world.
			Through my time here, I've become very familiar with C++, Python, the Robot Operating System (ROS), Linux based platforms, and have run the gamut of bringing a physical robot from a sketch on paper to an autonomous machine.
		</p>
		<p>
			Before coming to UR, I spent two years at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) earning my Master's of Science in Mechanical Engineering while working in the Bioinspired Systems Engineering Laboratory (BioSEL) led by Dr. Kathleen Lamkin-Kennard.
			There, I performed research developing a novel soft robotics actuation device.
			This research became the topic of my <a href="https://scholarworks.rit.edu/theses/10142/"target="_blank">Master's Thesis</a>.
			It was my first taste of real research in an academic environment, where my responsibilities were more than "the undergrad that works in the lab with us".
		</p>
		<p>
			In between the completion of my MS degree at RIT and beginning the PhD program at UR, I spent one year in the Base Controls group at Magna Powertrain as a mechatronics systems engineer.
			At Magna my primary role was designing and running experiments in the field, analyzing the data gathered from those experiments, and making necessary developments and adjustments to the control system software in four-wheel-drive vehicles from "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Three_(automobile_manufacturers)"target="_blank">The Big Three</a>".
		</p>
		<p>
			Leading up to the start of my MS program at RIT, I earned my Bachelor's of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI).
			I spent a few months in the New York State Center for Future Energy Systems laboratory as "the undergrad that works in the lab with us" developing methods of laser sintering copper nanoparticles to glass, and designing enclosures for the lasers in the laboratory.
			My time at RPI built up my proficiency in MATLAB, CAD, and fundamental engineering and research skills.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have a diverse background spanning from business development and innovation, to physical modeling and hardware development from my mechanical engineering background at RPI and RIT, to mechatronics, control systems engineering, electrical engineering, and robotics from my time at Magna and UR.
			I am always trying to stretch these muscles with <a href="../projects/main.html"target="_self">personal projects</a> and continued activity in these fields.
			I look forward to more learning opportunities and project collaborations ahead!
